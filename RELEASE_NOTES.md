### For Developers

If you're using any service methods directly, note that they now accept an optional `contextLogger` parameter:

```typescript
// Before
await SessionService.createSession(user, req, res);

// After (contextLogger is optional)
await SessionService.createSession(user, req, res, contextLogger);
```

### Test Updates

All service tests have been updated to include proper mock contextLogger setup. Refer to the existing test files for examples.
